1. Dscribe the main principle of a scatterploy
The main principle of a scatterplot matrix (SPLOM) is to break down high-dimensional multivariate data into multiple 2D pairwise relationships. 
It arranges scatterplots of every combination of variable pairs in a grid (matrix) format. 
This allows users to visualize correlations (e.g., positive or negative) and patterns between all pairs of attributes simultaneously.

2.How many scatterplots for n attributes?
Total: n^2 plots. For n attributes, the scatterplot matrix consists of n times n = n^2 cells.
Note: The n cells on the diagonal typically show the univariate distribution (e.g., histograms or labels) since they represent the variable against itself. 
The off-diagonal plots show the pairwise relationships.

3.Advantages & Disadvantages
Advantages:
Overview of Correlations: It provides a comprehensive overview of all pairwise correlations between attributes in a single view.
Pattern Discovery: It allows users to quickly spot patterns such as linear relationships, clusters, or outliers across multiple dimensions.
Direct Comparison: The grid layout facilitates easy comparison of correlation strength between different pairs of attributes.
Disadvantages:
Scalability Issues: Limited scalability regarding the number of attributes. As n increases, the number of plots grows quadratically n^2, making individual plots too small to read.
Overplotting: Suffering from overplotting if the dataset is large, making it hard to see the density of data points.
Limited to Pairwise Relationships: It only visualizes 2D pairwise relationships, potentially missing complex interactions involving three or more variables simultaneously.
